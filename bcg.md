Context: Client is a major gas and eletrical utility supplying to small
and medium enterprises and residential customers. Problem:
Power-liberization of the energy market has led to customer churn. Null
hypothesis (Based on client): Price sensitivity is not a significant
factor leading to customer churn. Alternative hypothesis (Based on

other companies and type of customers.
